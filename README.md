# Senior Project April 2023
This project was completed for my Senior Capstone project. It is a touchscreen/Arduino controlled touchscreen radio. It Further has the ability to control volume from the screen, channel, and swith the radio into aux mode. 

The circuitry was designed and made by me; the arduino, radio module, amplifiers, and part of the AC to DC step down were the only portions not made physically made.

I worked closely with Jasraj Singh (software support), Harneha Kaur(hardware support), and Sandro Zro (3D Housing and software support).
