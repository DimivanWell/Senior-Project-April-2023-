# Senior Project April 2023
This project was completed for my Senior Capstone project. It is a touchscreen/Arduino controlled touchscreen radio. It Further has the ability to control volume from the screen, channel, and swith the radio into aux mode. 

The circuitry was designed and made by me; the arduino, radio module, amplifiers, and part of the AC to DC step down were the only portions not made physically made.

I worked closely with Jasraj Singh (software support), Harneha Kaur(hardware support), and Sandro Zro (3D Housing and software support).

In this repository I the circuitry break down, code for the touch screen controller, and overview can be found.

Huge shout out to [Rinky-Dink Electronics](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=92) for their screen driver packages.

A seven segment lettering package was used to make the screen feel more 'radio-ie'. This can be found in the Rinky-Dink Files named [SevenSegmentFull.c](Rinky-Dink Files/SevenSegmentFull.c) **Note: make sure this file inside the same directory as your .ino file inorder to properlly call the package within the code
